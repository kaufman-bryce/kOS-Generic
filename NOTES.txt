PARAMETER ORDER CHANGED ON LAUNCH SCRIPT; UPDATE CALLERS!!!

Dependency manager:
	Reads .ks files to discover dependencies; retrieves from archive if not present and runs them.
	Identifier looks like this:
	
//DEPENDS{/absolute/path/to/file,/abs/path/to/2ndfile}


Modifications to launch script
	✔Accept target parameter (orbital or set of kepler elements)
		✔Detect type of first parameter
			✔If vessel or body orbiting parent, launch into plane.
				If target is parent of current body, just launch normal.
			✔If number, assume altitude with param 2 inclination.
				If param 3, treat as LAN. Otherwise ignore LAN.
			
	✔Launch to LAN as well as inc
		✔By default, ignores LAN.
	✔Integrate launch window functionality
		✔Adjust to accept target normal instead of target (permits launch to hypothetical orbits)
		Detect when rInc is low (<1?) and skip window
		✔Detect when waiting for window will take excessive time (tidal locked); skip, or set alarm and exit?
	If target selected, correct plane as well?
		Technically not part of launch, but any reason not to do this?
	Rendevous is outside the purview of a launch program.
